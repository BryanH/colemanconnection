  <h1>Getting started...</h1>

  <p>
    Before you create an account on HCC Coleman Connection, we'd like to share some important information
    with you. This information will prepare you to meet with the program you have decided to apply for.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've split the information into 3 sections. These sections discuss life before you become an HCC Coleman
    College student, what you can expect after you've been accepted into one of programs, and what life is
    like for a student that graduates from HCC Coleman College.
  </p>

  <p>
    It may seem like a lot of information, but don't worry, it goes pretty quickly.
